    "# p300 Speller Application\n",
    "By: Thomas Blalock<br>\n",

    "### Abstract\n",
    "This paper details the development of a brain-computer interface (BCI) speller application using electroencephalography (EEG) to detect P300 event-related potentials. The system utilizes a 3D-printed EEG helmet with 8 electrodes positioned to optimize P300 detection. Custom stimulus-producing software was created, including a box GUI to elicit strong P300 responses for pretraining and a QWERTY keyboard GUI to enable communication. Over 3,000 EEG samples were collected, preprocessed with filtering and smoothing techniques, and used to train a 5-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify P300 responses. However, the CNN only achieved 51.30% validation accuracy, slightly better than the 50% baseline. Next steps to improve accuracy include collecting more training data, enhancing data preprocessing, and exploring different model architectures like recurrent neural networks. Overall, this research lays the groundwork for a BCI speller but further optimization is required to achieve usable accuracy.\n",

    "### Introduction\n",
    "A brain-computer interface (BCI) reads and interprets the electromagnetic fields created by neural activity. This project employs a specific type of non-invasive BCI called electroencephalography (EEG), which reads electrical signals using electrodes that sit on a person's scalp. this project seeks to create a system called a speller application to enable people to communicate without any motor movement. Different BCI spellers utilize different signals in the brain. These various strategies for speller applications are referred to as speller paradigms. We employ the p300 speller paradigm, which utilizes the p300 novelty response in the brain that can be triggered by flashing colors as well as a digital keyboard that flashes in different patterns to determine what a subject is looking at. On the back-end, a classification model parses the data to determine if the p300 response is present. Significant noise is introduced in EEG systems, originating from other processes in the brain, the environment, and other processes in the body, such as blinking. Every part of this system pipeline can be optimized. The quality of the stimulus-producing software determines the size of the p300 response. The quality of data cleaning and feature extraction could determine if the model converges. And lastly, the quality of the machine learning model determines if the system yields the correct response. A literature report linked [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aNbAXmB_J7fFUMmZ_Ofe9Z-wUfX3AwkIEsbiiaiTxu8/edit?usp=sharing) further details the methods and paradigms mentioned in this report."

    "### Hardware Setup\n",
    "In this project, we used a 3D-printed plastic frame with eight OpenBCI electrodes and an OpenBCI Cyton Board. The equipment was provided by Dr. Mello from the USAFA ACCR. The electrodes were placed in the p300 configuration found at this [link](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Common-electrode-setup-for-P300-spellers-according-to-8-Eight-EEG-electrodes-are_fig1_221583051#:~:text=Eight%20EEG%20electrodes%20are%20placed,is%20attached%20to%20the%20rig). The wires were oriented orthogonal to each other to minimize cross-contamination.<br><br>\n",

    "### Hardware-Software Integration\n",
    "The software generated to interact with the helmet assumes that the helmet transmits the signal to the computer through a USB port. Since only one process can access a USB port at a time, our scripts and the OpenBCI GUI cannot be running at the same time. A 'Board' object was created to handle all interactions with the EEG helmet. The code is modular enough so that it would be very easy to change the script to receive the signal over wifi rather than the USB port. Run the following code block to define this object."

    "The end goal is to have a QWERTY keyboard that utilizes a binary search with the p300 responses to find the letter that a subject is looking at. It was determined that the machine learning model would converge more quickly if it was first trained on a more prominent p300 signal and then trained on the QWERTY keyboard. There are two GUI objects that flash different colors to stimulate the P300 response. The first version flashes different-sized boxes while the second version performs the binary search using a QWERTY keyboard with some non-letter values. "

    "The first GUI is just a flashing box. It is designed to elicit a strong p300. The data collected using this GUI will be used to pretrain the model. The model will theoretically converge faster on a dataset with a more pronounced loss landscape. The GUI enables the user to specify differently sized and shaped boxes. This variation allows the user to vary the size of the p300 response since the size of the flashing box will likely correlate to the size of the p300 response. Multiple colors flash during a single sample. The colors and time between flashes are randomized to maximize the p300 response.

    "##### Data Collection for Curriculum Training\n",
    "Designing two different methods to elicit the p300 response serves to enable the machine learning model to converge faster. Theoretically, the more pronounced the p300 response is in the data, the easier it will be for the model to identify it. Interpreted another way, the loss landscape for data with a more pronounced p300 response is less complex than it would be otherwise, meaning that the model would be less likely to get stuck in an unusable local minimum during training. An acceptable local minimum for this 'easy' dataset would likely be close enough to an acceptable local minimum for the 'harder' dataset. Thus, pretraining the model on the 'easy' dataset would enable the model to converge much faster on the 'hard' dataset. In this context, the 'easy' dataset includes samples gathered from the box GUI since having the entire screen flash takes up more visual space---and thus more cognitive space---than flashing a key on a QWERTY keyboard. The 'hard' dataset is composed of samples collected from the QWERTY keyboard. This process of pretraining on an 'easy' dataset before training the model directly on your real objective is referred to as 'curriculum training'."

If a machine learning model is trained on a dataset with too many of one class, it will learn to always predict that class. To avoid this, we balance the dataset. There are two main methods of balancing datasets. The first is to augment the under-represented class by duplicating samples or adding transformed samples. The second method is to 'downsample', which means to remove samples of the over-represented class until the dataset contains equal amounts of classes. In this project, we undersample the dataset since it is more costly to transform the dataset with augmentations than it is to just collect more data. Thus, we will have an abundance of data and can afford to downsample."

    "The first model trained in this project was a simple convolutional neural network with five  one-dimensional convolutional layers and two dense layers. The network is sized to receive an input of 250 observations, which includes readings from the start of the stimulus to roughly 250 milliseconds past the surfacing of the p300 response. Batch normalization was applied to each of the convolutional layers to minimize overfitting. An Exponential Linear Unit (ELU) activation function was used to introduce non-linearity. This activation function selection was based on experimental results from the [Universal Joint Feature Extraction for P300 EEG Classification Using Multi-Task Autoencoder](https://github.com/IoBT-VISTEC/Pre-trained-EEG-for-Deep-Learning) project."

    "### Model Training\n",
    "The Universal Joint Feature Extraction for P300 EEG Classification Using Multi-Task Autoencoder project also used the 'Adam' optimizer, which dynamically adjusts learning rates. It handles sparse gradients on noisy problems, like signals regression, very well. This project used 'Binary Cross Entropy Loss' as the loss function. This is the standard choice of loss function for binary classification problems. The following three code blocks define a training and testing function, initialize the model, loss function, and optimizer, and trains and tests the model."

    "### Results\n",
    "Overall, roughly 3,000 samples of data were collected. These samples were collected in optimal conditions in locations and times with no periphery stimulus-producing distractions and no extraneous electrical signals. The first iteration of a classification model (EEG_Net_CNN) did not perform well enough over 100 epochs for use in a speller application. The model was initially trained on unnormalized data and did not achieve a usable accuracy. The model was then retrained on fully preprocessed data. It achieved a better yet still unusable testing accuracy of 51.30%. A more full analysis will be performed on the model after it has been optimized and has achieved a non-trivial performance gain over the baseline. A column chart comparing the baseline accuracy to the EEG_Net_CNN's accuracy is provided below:\n",

    "### Next Steps\n",
    "There is one main shortcoming in this project: the classification model's performance. This can be due to one or more of three factors:\n",
    "- The quality and size of the training dataset.\n",
    "- The quality of the data preprocessing.\n",
    "- The architecture and training algorithm of the model.\n",
    "##### Dataset\n",
    "Great pains were taken to optimize the p300 response and to ensure that all data collected was of good quality. Furthermore, 3,000 samples of data would be enough to fully train a small classification network like the EEG_Net_CNN. However, if the size of the neural network is increased, then more samples will need to be collected.\n",
    "##### Data Preprocessing\n",
    "All the applied data preprocessing steps are generally needed for neural networks to converge quickly with signals data. Thus, none of the current preprocessing steps should be removed. However, the bandpass filter currently allows too much noise to filter through. The high frequency cutoff will be optimized further to reduce noise. Additionally, autoencoders are commonly used to extract features from signals data. An autoencoder will be trained and used to extract latent representations for further processing.\n",
    "##### Model\n",
    "The simple CNN was unable to parse the EEG data. Before trying different model architectures, we will tune the hyperparameters and model parameters, such as the convolution kernel sizes, to increase the accuracy of this model. CNNs have been successful in classifying EEG data for speller applications in the past. This means that an optimal size and optimal hyperparameters would likely enable our model to perform well. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have also been made to perform well on EEG data in the past. Because everybody's brain operates differently, each brain has a different baseline. Perhaps, a RNN can learn how to characterize a specific person's neural patterns in its hidden state. After optimizing the CNN, we will wrap the CNN with a LSTM RNN to test if a hidden state increases accuracy. Lastly, other neural networks have been trained on EEG data to detect the p300 stimulus response. Finding a pretrained model and modifying that model with additional layers for transfer learning could yield a usable model faster than building a network from scratch."
